# Twitter Bot Classification Neural Network

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classification model with 2 Dense hidden layers in a sequential framework with a Dropout layer applied. The model uses a public Kaggle dataset from the Twitter API containing over 37,000 profiles classified as humans or bots.

The ANN model is created using the Keras library to build and fit the model. A randomized search CV is used to identify the best hypertuned parameters.

A detailed explanation of the model is included in the Jupyter Notebook below.
