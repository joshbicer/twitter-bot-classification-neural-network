# Twitter Bot Classification Neural Network

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classification model with 2 Dense hidden layers in a sequential framework with Dropout layer applied. The model uses a public Kaggle dataset from the Twitter API containing over 37,000 profiles classified as humans or bots.
